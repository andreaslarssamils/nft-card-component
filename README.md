## My process

### Built with

- HTML5

### What I learned

I have used basic html and css, which have reinforced my knowledge about html css.

### Continued development

I will come back to this project and fix opacity problem with the eye icon. The icon is supposed to be white. I don't know how to do it so if there is any who know how to solve it you are very welcome to explain on how to do it.
